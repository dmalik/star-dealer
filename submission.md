- I'm not the biggest Star Wars fan but I seen the few logos in Font Awesome which was already provided so I decided to make a theme of it. I have seen the movies.
- I decided to use modal windows instead of a side panel to make the page responsive.
- If doing this for a larger project or app I would have split out elements like buttons and inputs into their own components
- In regards to the extra considerations. I would handle some of these with build tools. Create React App comes with Service Workers out of the box. Next.js would provide SSR, code splitting, and lazy loading. A post processor, HMR and using ES6 modules would also be nice modern tool additions.
- When there are no events I added the ability to load up a few to test out the layout.
- It seems a spent a bit too much time playing around with the styles vs actually adding functionality. I find this is usually the case when I don't start with a design to develop against. Oh well, I was having fun :)
- I would have liked to spend more time designing the modals but ran out of time.
